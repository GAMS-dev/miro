\title{DBIObject class}
\description{
Base class for all other DBI classes (e.g., drivers, connections). This
is a virtual Class: No objects may be created from it.
}
\details{
More generally, the DBI defines a very small set of classes and generics that
allows users and applications access DBMS with a common interface.  The
virtual classes are \code{DBIDriver} that individual drivers extend,
\code{DBIConnection} that represent instances of DBMS connections, and
\code{DBIResult} that represent the result of a DBMS statement.  These three
classes extend the basic class of \code{DBIObject}, which serves as the root
or parent of the class hierarchy.
}
\section{Implementation notes}{

An implementation MUST provide methods for the following generics:

\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=dbGetInfo]{dbGetInfo()}}.
}

It MAY also provide methods for:

\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=summary]{summary()}}. Print a concise description of the
object. The default method invokes \code{dbGetInfo(dbObj)} and prints
the name-value pairs one per line.  Individual implementations may
tailor this appropriately.
}
}

\examples{
drv <- RSQLite::SQLite()
con <- dbConnect(drv)

rs <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT 1")
is(drv, "DBIObject")   ## True
is(con, "DBIObject")   ## True
is(rs, "DBIObject")

dbClearResult(rs)
dbDisconnect(con)
