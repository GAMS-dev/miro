                      Once you are happy with the MIRO application you
                      developed, you can deploy it. This chapter guides you
                      through this process.

                    <p>
                      Deploying a MIRO application is the process of exporting
                      and installing your app so that it can be easily shared
                      and used in the daily business of your end users. Before
                      you can deploy an app, it needs to be fully set up: no
                      further changes to the model or the configuration can be
                      made once it is deployed. In case you did not configure
                      your MIRO app yet, read the chapters about
                      <a href="./model.html">model preparation</a> and
                      <a href="./customize.html">configuration</a>.

                  <p>
                    The deployment of an application consists of two parts: The
                    creation of a self-contained app bundle and its
                    installation.
                  </p>
                  <div class="section-block" id="sbs-create-app">

                    <b id="model-assembly-file">The model assembly file:</b
                    ><br />
                    <p>
                      Before you export your app bundle, MIRO needs to know
                      about the files that belong to your model. This is
                      primarily the main model file, but also all files
                      necessary to calculate all inputs and outputs, e.g. files
                      that are included in the model. To tell MIRO about these
                      files, create a text file in the root directory of your
                      model called
                      <span class="code">&lt;modelname&gt;_files.txt</span> or
                      use <i>GAMS Studio</i> to create this file for you. For
                      the latter go to <i>MIRO</i> &rarr;
                      <i>Assembly and Deploy</i>. In the
                      <i>Assembly File</i> section you can select those folders
                      and files which are needed. If you select a folder, all
                      files in it will be included. If you want to use only
                      single files of a folder, you have to expand the folder
                      and select the corresponding file(s).

                          Files or folders created by MIRO (e.g.
                          <span class="code">conf_&lt;modelname&gt;</span>,
                          <span class="code">data_&lt;modelname&gt;</span>,
                          <span class="code">static_&lt;modelname&gt;</span>) do
                          not need to be included in the assembly file. MIRO
                          knows about these files and includes them
                          automatically.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                      If you want to create the text file on your own, specify
                      the relative paths to the files that are part of your
                      model separated by a new line. An example for a model
                      named <span class="code">example</span> can be found
                      below:
                    </p>
                    <h6 class="block-title" style="margin-top: 15px">
                      example_files.txt

                    <p>
                      This would result in the files
                      <span class="code">example.gms</span>,
                      <span class="code">inc/inc1.inc</span>,
                      <span class="code">inc/inc2.inc</span> and the entire
                      directory <span class="code">data</span> to be included.

                    <p>
                      Once you specified the files that belong to your model,
                      you are ready to export your MIRO app!

                      In GAMS Studio, select <i>Assembly and Deploy</i>. In the
                      <i>Deploy Configuration</i> section, you need to decide
                      how your model shall be executed (<i
                        >execution environment</i
                      >). There are three options:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Multi-user: This option allows your app to be used by
                        multiple users simultaneously. Your model files are
                        extracted at a random location, which is different for
                        each user, and your model is executed from there.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Single-user: Your model is executed inside the model
                        directory. No extraction of your model files is
                        required, but this means that you can NOT have multiple
                        users accessing your MIRO app at the same time.
                      </li>
                      <li id="local-multi-user">
                        Local multi-user (uses <i>idir</i>): With this third
                        option, your model is again executed from a random
                        location, but this time no model data is extracted here.
                        Instead, GAMS is executed with an
                        <a
                          href="https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GamsCall.html#GAMSAOinputdir"
                          target="_blank"
                          >input directory</a
                        >
                        pointing to the path where your model files are located.
                        Choose this option ONLY if you have many large files
                        that belong to your model and extracting them would take
                        a long time. Be aware that due to the fact that
                        <span class="code">idir</span> is used, your model might
                        brake! For example, if you use
                        <code class="language-gams">$call</code> or the
                        execution-time equivalent
                        <code class="language-gams">execute</code> (or related
                        functions), the relative paths used in these calls will
                        no longer exist (since the
                        <a
                          href="https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GamsCall.html#GAMSAOcurdir"
                          >curdir</a
                        >
                        is now a random location). The solution is to prefix all
                        these relative paths with
                        <code class="language-gams">%gams.idir1%</code>. For
                        example, in order to import an Excel file
                        <span class="code">test.xlsx</span>, GDXXRW needs to be
                        called like this:
                        <kbd>$call gdxxrw i=%gams.idir1%test.xlsx</kbd>.
                        Alternatively, you can also use absolute paths (e.g. via
                        <code class="language-gams"
                          >$setNames "%gams.input%" fp fn fe</code
                        >
                        (see
                        <a
                          href="https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_DollarControlOptions.html#DOLLARsetnames"
                          target="_blank"
                          >here</a
                        >). <br />Adjusting all affected paths is potentially a
                        lot of work, so we strongly advise against using this
                        option unless you know what you are doing!

                          We advise you to test your MIRO app before
                          distributing it. GAMS Studio offers an option
                          <i>test deployment</i>. This simulates how your end
                          users will experience the MIRO app (e.g. for the
                          <i>Base Mode</i> MIRO is launched in the specified
                          execution environment). In particular, you should
                          check whether you forgot to include important files in
                          the

                    <p>
                      In case you want to distribute scenario data with your
                      MIRO application, you can do so by simply placing
                      MIROSCEN, GDX, CSV or XLSX files in the
                      <span class="code">data_&lt;modelname&gt;</span>
                      directory. When your MIRO app is started for the first
                      time, these datasets will be stored in the MIRO database.
                      The filename is used as the scenario name. To learn more,
                      read the chapter on
                      <a href="./start.html#startup-import"
                        >importing multiple scenarios on startup</a
                      >. Note that the owner of these scenarios is the user that
                      launches the MIRO app for the first time!
                    </p>
                    <h6>Assign a default logo</h6>
                    <p>
                      When adding the MIRO app to the MIRO library, the user has
                      the option to choose a logo to quickly identify your app.
                      If you want to suggest a logo, simply place am image
                      (format: png/jpg/jpeg; aspect ratio: 8 &times; 5 fits
                      best) with the name
                      <span class="code">app_logo</span> inside the
                      <span class="code">static_&lt;modelname&gt;</span> folder
                      before deploying. When a user imports your app, this logo
                      will be suggested to them. If no such file is found, a
                      default logo is used.

                    <p>
                      When adding a new MIRO app to the library, a user can
                      specify an app title as well as a short description. If
                      you want to provide defaults for these, you can do so via
                      a JSON file <span class="code">app_info.json</span> inside
                      the
                      <span class="code">static_&lt;modelname&gt;</span> folder.
                      The JSON file has to have the following structure:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-json">{
    "title": "Example app",

}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                      If everything is set, click on <i>Deploy</i>. That's it! A
                      new file
                      <span class="code">&lt;modelname&gt;.miroapp</span> is
                      created in your model directory. You can now distribute
                      this MIRO app directly to your end users!

                      <kbd>static_&lt;modelname&gt;</kbd> directory of your app.
                      You can use the following template:

    ]
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>
                      Make sure you also add the two icons
                      <kbd>logo192.png</kbd> (192x192 pixels) and
                      <kbd>logo512.png</kbd> (512x512 pixels) to the
                      <kbd>static_&lt;modelname&gt;</kbd> directory. They will
                      be used when adding your app to the home screen on Android
                      devices. For iOS devices, add another icon named
                      <kbd>apple-touch-icon.png</kbd> with a size of 180x180
                      pixels. The <kbd>pickstock</kbd> sample application
                      contains a manifest that you can use as a reference.

                      The MIRO Desktop interface offers several ways to control

                      <i>Paths</i> and to the <i>Environment</i>. In the
                      <i>General</i> category you can specify whether you want
                      to launch your MIRO apps in a new window of the MIRO
                      Launcher or in your default browser. You can set the
                      language, specify the level of detail of information to be
                      logged as well as the number of days you want your log
                      files to be stored for (-1 being no limit).

                    <p>
                      In the <i>Paths</i> section, you can control the location
                      where your MIRO apps are stored/loaded from and the
                      location where log files are kept. Additionally, in case
                      you want to use a specific GAMS version or the MIRO
                      Launcher was unable to locate GAMS automatically, you can
                      set the path to GAMS here. On Linux, you can also specify
                      the path to the required R installation here.

                      In the <i>Environment</i> section, you can import a
                      customized environment to be used by your MIRO apps. This
                      is useful, for example, if you want to run

                    <p>
                      Environment variables names must consist solely of
                      uppercase letters, digits and '_' (underscore) and must
                      not start with a digit. Note that the
                      <kbd>PATH</kbd> environment variable is special in that
                      MIRO prepends it to the already existing <kbd>PATH</kbd>.

                    <p>
                      This section covers the options you have when you want to
                      share MIRO apps and/or scenarios between multiple users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      First, you need to specify a location in your file system
                      where your MIRO apps are stored. To change the directory
                      where MIRO apps are stored, go to
                      <i>Preferences</i> &rarr; <i>Paths</i> and change the
                      "MIRO app path" to a directory where all collaborating
                      users have at least read access. Users that are allowed to
                      add/edit/remove apps need write access as well. Note that
                      this only handles the location of where the MIRO apps are
                      stored and loaded from, not the location of the MIRO
                      database that the apps use. If you want your users to
                      share the same database (in order to collaborate), you can
                      specify its location by clicking on <i>Edit</i> (<span
                        class="key"
                        >Ctrl</span
                      >
                      + <span class="key">E</span> or
                      <span class="key">⌘</span> + <span class="key">E</span> on
                      macOS).

                    <h3>Share settings</h3>
                    <p>
                      In addition to sharing MIRO apps, you may want to share
                      settings such as "Paths" to the GAMS/R installation or
                      even "General" settings such as the log file verbosity. To
                      do so, you have to create a file:
                      <span class="code">settings.json</span> at the location of
                      the shared MIRO app path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Let's look at an example: You created a shared directory
                      <span class="code">&lt;sharedFolder&gt;</span> where you
                      have read and write access and all the other collaborators
                      only have read permissions. You select this directory in
                      your MIRO settings (<i>Preferences</i> &rarr;
                      <i>Paths</i> &rarr; <i>MIRO app path</i>) and install your
                      MIRO applications here. In addition, you want to set some
                      default settings. Therefore, you create a file
                      <span class="code"
                        >&lt;sharedFolder&gt;\settings.json</span
                      >:
                    </p>

    "launchExternal": false,
    "logLifeTime": -1,

}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                      Users that set their MIRO app path to
                      <span class="code">&lt;sharedFolder&gt;</span> will now
                      also load these settings in addition to the apps installed
                      here (in this example the GAMS path is set to
                      <span class="code">C:\GAMS\win64\30.2</span>, the MIRO app
                      is not launched in the default browser but inside a native
                      MIRO window and the logs are never removed).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The "important" key is special: settings listed here
                      ("logLifeTime" and "gamspath") will be fixed, meaning the
                      user can not overwrite these. This is useful if you don't
                      want your users to change certain options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The schema for the
                      <span class="code">settings.json</span> file is as

                      From time to time, you may want to update your MIRO
                      application. Most updates, such as changing the layout of
                      your application, adjusting the renderers, or even
                      improving your GAMS model, are not problematic. It gets
                      more complicated when you change the GAMS/MIRO data
                      contract, i.e. anything between the
                      <code class="language-gams">$onExternalInput</code> /
                      <code class="language-gams">$offExternalInput</code> or
                      <code class="language-gams">$onExternalOutput</code> /
                      <code class="language-gams">$offExternalOutput</code>
                      tags. MIRO stores all of your application's data in a
                      relational database. This means that every time you change
                      the domains of a symbol (add/remove/rename indices) or
                      remove/rename external input and/or output symbols, the
                      database must be migrated to the new data contract.
                      Fortunately, MIRO offers a <i>Migration Wizard</i> to
                      assist you with this process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Let's look at an example where we have added a time
                      dimension to the <i>transport</i> example model:
                    </p>
                    <div
                      class="section-block"
                      style="text-align: center; cursor: pointer"
                    >
                      <img
                        class="img-fluid"
                        style="max-height: 350pt"
                        src="assets/images/deployment/migration-wizard.png"
                        alt="Migration Wizard for transport model with added time dimension"
                        onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"
                      />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      You can see that we need to migrate data from the three
                      symbols: <code class="language-gams">schedule</code>,
                      <code class="language-gams">a0</code> and
                      <code class="language-gams">b</code>. The symbols
                      <code class="language-gams">schedule</code> and
                      <code class="language-gams">b</code> now have an
                      additional dimension <code class="language-gams">t</code>.
                      Before this new version, we did not have this dimension,
                      so we choose <kbd>-</kbd> here to indicate that this data
                      is missing. If we were to load a scenario that was saved
                      with an old version of our app, the data in these columns
                      would be marked as <i>NA</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As we renamed the symbol
                      <code class="language-gams">a</code> to
                      <code class="language-gams">a0</code>, we indicate that
                      data for symbol
                      <code class="language-gams">a0</code> should come from
                      <code class="language-gams">a</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Note that as an alternative to migrating existing data, we
                      also have the option to remove all existing data by
                      clicking the <kbd>Delete all database tables</kbd> button
                      in the lower left corner.

                          Before you migrate the data, you should perform a
                          backup of your database. If you are using MIRO
