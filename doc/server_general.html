                      With GAMS MIRO Server, the model calculations and the MIRO
                      applications themselves are moved to the cloud. Apps
                      deployed with MIRO Server can be accessed from any device
                      with a modern web browser. Local MIRO or GAMS
                      installations and licenses are no longer necessary. This
                      makes MIRO Server the most convenient solution when it
                      comes to making apps available to end users all over the
                      world. All you need as a user is a URL, valid credentials
                      (optional) and you are ready to go.

                      Besides the benefits of making them easily accessible,
                      central hosting of MIRO apps also brings other aspects
                      into focus:

                    <p>
                      Jobs that are solved with GAMS Engine in the cloud are
                      always processed asynchronously. This has the following
                      advantages:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        You can submit several jobs in a row without having to
                        wait for the results of previous jobs.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A MIRO application does not have to keep running during
                        the calculations, i.e. you can close the application and
                        return at a later time to view the results.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Instead of a normal 'Solve Model' button like in MIRO
                      Desktop, a dropdown menu appears in a MIRO app running
                      under MIRO Server:

                          cursor: pointer;
                        "

                        alt="Solve button"
                        onclick="window.open(this.src, '_blank');"
                      />
                    </div>
                    <p>The choices are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Solve model:</b><br />
                        <p>
                          The workflow is identical to the synchronous solving
                          in MIRO Desktop. After clicking on
                          <i>Solve model</i> the view changes to the
                          <i>GAMS interaction</i> section, where log and listing
                          files are shown during the calculations (if they are
                          not hidden). After solving the view changes to the
                          output section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Note that unlike MIRO Desktop, the job is now executed
                          asynchronously. You can therefore close the MIRO app
                          during the calculations. From the moment you log out
                          and log back in, the job will be treated as a job that
                          you submitted by clicking <i>submit job</i> rather
                          than <i>solve model</i>. This means no log will be
                          displayed anymore in the
                          <i>GAMS interaction</i> section. Also, the results are
                          not loaded automatically after solving. Instead the
                          job is moved to the
                          <a href="#job-list" class="scrollto">job list</a>.
                          From there you can get the results after finishing the
                          calculations.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Submit job:</b><br />
                        A submitted job is put directly into the
                        <a href="#job-list" class="scrollto">job list</a>. No
                        log is displayed, and results are not automatically
                        loaded into the interface. Instead, the results can be
                        imported later. Submitting a job in this way makes sense
                        especially if you want to solve multiple jobs in a row
                        without waiting for the results to come in.
                      </li>

                      The job list in the GAMS interaction section lists all

                      name. In addition, the current status (<i>scheduled</i>,

                          The user who shares a scenario with others is the
                          scenario owner. The scenario owner is displayed to
                          other users when they load a shared scenario into
                          their sandbox.

                          Access permissions are assigned to a shared scenario.
                          As scenario owner you decide about who has read, write
                          and/or execute permissions. Users with read
                          permissions can load the owner's scenario but are not
                          authorized to edit or execute it. The scenario is
                          marked with a lock symbol (<i class="fas fa-lock"></i
                          >). Write permissions give you the right to change the
                          scenario (data) and save it again. With execute
                          permissions you are authorized to solve the scenario.

                          It is not possible to revoke the owner's access

                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Users with read access can duplicate the scenario via
                          the "Save as" button. They become the owner of this
                          new scenario.

                        <li>
                          For the time a scenario is opened in MIRO, it is
                          locked for other users. This prevents conflicts
                          arising when a scenario is used concurrently. Locked
                          scenarios can be opened in readonly mode by others
                          (and also saved under a new name). A lock symbol (<i

                          ></i
                          >) next to the scenario name indicates the readonly
                          status. Users with write permissions for the scenario
                          are additionally informed about this via a
                          notification in the lower right corner of the screen.

                        In the example below, Rebecca is scenario owner. She
                        gives the single user 'rschuchmann' and the group 'group
                        1' read permission for her scenario. Since she does not
                        want her scenario data to be changed, she decides not to
                        give write permissions to any other user. Members of
                        'group 1' usually only look at results and do not want
                        to start optimization runs. Therefore, Rebecca only
                        grants execution rights to "rschuchmann".

                      With <i>GAMS MIRO Desktop - Boosted by GAMS Engine</i>,
                      you can solve GAMS jobs in the cloud with your locally
                      running MIRO applications. This setup requires GAMS Engine
                      (read more about the installation of GAMS Engine
                      <a href="https://www.gams.com/engine/installation.html"
                        >here</a
                      >). To switch from running your optimization jobs on your
                      local machine to solving them in the cloud, open your MIRO
                      library, go to <i>Preferences</i> &rarr;
                      <i>GAMS Engine</i> and check the "Execution of models on
                      GAMS Engine" checkbox. This setting affects all deployed
                      MIRO apps (started via the MIRO library) and all MIRO apps
                      in development (started via GAMS Studio or the command

                      (e.g. <kbd>https://engine.gams.com</kbd> if you are using
                      Engine SaaS), an Engine namespace for which you have at
                      least write and execute rights, as well as your login

                      If you are a developer and want to use a not yet deployed
                      MIRO app with Engine, you need to create the
                      <i>model assembly file</i> first. With this you tell MIRO
                      which files belong to the GAMS model. This is primarily
                      the main model file, but also all files necessary to
                      calculate all inputs and outputs, e.g. files that are
                      included in the model. Read more about the model assembly

                      information is required:

                      If a MIRO application runs with GAMS Engine backend, jobs
                      are solved
                      <a href="#solve-async">asynchronously</a>. All submitted
                      jobs can be found and imported in the
                      <a href="#job-list">joblist</a> in the GAMS interaction
                      section.

                    <p>
                      When a model is sent from MIRO to GAMS Engine, it is
                      executed in a Linux environment. This means that
                      Windows-only tools like
                      <a href="https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_GDXXRW.html"
                        >GDXXRW</a
                      >
                      are not available and a corresponding call in the model
                      will lead to an error on GAMS Engine. Furthermore it has
                      to be considered that Linux is case-sensitive. It should
                      therefore be ensured that file system calls (file paths as
                      well as file names) from within the model code are
                      correctly capitalized. The model is executed in an
                      isolated environment ("container"). Therefore it is
                      important that file paths can be applied correctly (e.g.
                      no hardcoded absolute paths).
