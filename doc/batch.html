                                    <p>The web interface allows the user to load input data, manipulate it, start & stop the GAMS optimization run, inspect the results as well as save, manage and compare different scenarios. </p>
                                    <p>Beside this "regular" WebUI there is another interface which allows to configure and evaluate so-called batch runs. A batch run describes the automated execution of a certain number of scenarios that differ with regard to their parameterization.</p>
                                    <p>Let's take the model "pickstock" as an example. In the regular WebUI, the user determines the maximum number of stocks of the Dow Jones that can be selected for the representative portfolio. He also determines the time up to which the model should be in the "training phase". With a click on solve he starts the GAMS run for this parameterized scenario.</p>
                                    <p>But what if the user wants to solve a multitude of such scenarios with different parameterizations one after the other in order to investigate the behavior of the solutions more closely?  To avoid having to configure and solve each scenario individually, there is the "batch" module. In this module any number of scenarios can be configured at once. </p>
                                    <p>Results of such batch runs can be stored in the database and inspected directly in the WebUI. For this purpose, the Automated Performance Analysis & Visualization tool <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Paver" target="_blank">PAVER</a> was integrated. The direct comparison of scenarios in the scenario view (via split screen / tab view) is also available. Furthermore, the GAMS WebUI allows you to download scenarios for external analysis. </p>
                                    <p>In short, the module presented here is designed to generate scenarios and analyze them. </p>
                                    <p>The following sections explain the basic aspects of batch mode, including its functionality and workflow.</p>

                                    <p>A scenario is characterized by a particular set of model input parameters. If, for example, for a run of the above mentioned pickstock model, the number of training periods is set to 95 and the maximum number of stocks to be selected is set to 5, then this parameterization characterizes the scenario. The batch configuration discussed here makes it possible to configure several such scenarios at once, so that they can then be calculated in a single process. </p>
                                    <p>The configuration of such a batch run for a model is done in the menu 'Configure batch run'. An example is given below.</p>
                                    <p><b>Note:</b> Currently, the batch module only supports parameterization via <a href="https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GamsCall.html" target="_blank">GAMS command line parameters</a>.

                                        <p>If you compare the parameterization options of the input data between a regular single run and the configuration of a batch run, you will notice that the input widgets have changed slightly. As an example the model pickstock is used again. As already mentioned, for parameterizing a single model run in the regular WebUI, you can specify both the number of training periods and the maximum number of stocks using a slider.
                                        In the batch configuration for these two compile-time parameters no simple slider are available anymore, but slider with 2 ends, so called range-slider. In addition, there is a 'step size' for the slider range to be configured by the user. The table below gives an overview of the widgets and their different appearance in the regular and the batch model parameterization.</p>

                                        <p>The convention of automatic scenario generation has the following implications: Unless explicitly specified in the WebUI configuration of the model, each parameter of the input data is included in the Cartesian product from all parameter variations. In other words: All combinations are generated from the configuration selected by the user and each individual combination is saved as a single scenario. </p>
                                        <div class="section-block">

                                        The slider configured in this way leads to 9 different scenarios.</p>

                                        <P>For the parameter 'number of days for training' the slider was set to a range between 40 and 130 with a step size of 5. The resulting scenarios would therefore be:</P>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Scenario 1: 'number of days for training' = 40</li>
                                        <li>Scenario 2: 'number of days for training' = 45</li>
                                        <li>Scenario 3: 'number of days for training' = 50</li>

                                        <li>Scenario 19: 'number of days for training' = 130</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The previously mentioned Cartesian product of all parameter variations is now used: It is created from the different variants of the two parameters 'maximum number of stocks to select' (9 variations) and 'number of days for training' (19 variations) resulting in 171 individual scenarios. </p>

                                        <p>It gets clear that the number of scenarios to be considered can increase very quickly with the number of parameters and their selected configuration. Depending on how computing intensive the underlying GAMS model is, it may be advisable to configure the scenarios carefully. <br>Individual parameters can be excluded from inclusion in the Cartesian product. These parameters would then remain unchanged for each scenario created. this can be done in the WebUI configuration for the GAMS model (i.e. in the config.json file) using the option <span class="code">"nobatch": "true"</span> or via <a href="./customize.html#config-gen">Configuration Generator</a>. </p>

                                        <span class="code">a90647a60897593b108947ee2eb940c572c172717fbf39a7a75cccd9b253c288: gams pickstock.gms --maxstock=5 --trainingdays=50 trace=_sys_trace_pickstock.trc traceopt=3</span>
                                        <br>Starting with an individual hash value for this scenario, the GAMS call <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">gams pickstock.gms --maxstock=5 --trainingdays=50</span> follows in the form of a text string. It becomes clear that the parameters selected in the WebUI are passed as compile-time variables (double-dash parameters). This must be considered in the GAMS model to be executed: Each parameter, which is represented as widget (slider, dropdown, checkbox, date selector) in the WebUI and therefore is to define an individual senario, must be addressed within the GAMS model as compile-time variable or GAMS option.
                                        <br>The picture does not show that the expected GAMS call will be followed by further details. In these, for example, the creation of a trace file is defined, which is necessary for the internal analysis using <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Paver" target="_blank">PAVER</a>. </p>
                                        <p>Since the strings in the form in which they are now available are not calls that can be interpreted by GAMS due to the hash value at the beginning, the information about the individual calls must be extracted. Probably the easiest way to do this is to take each GAMS call and execute it with the help of a script in a separate folder (which is best named after the hash value of the scenario in order to be able to identify each scenario easily), in which the results are also stored. If the scenarios are to be executed on a special compute server, it is a good idea to take all necessary precautions, which have to be considered in the script (e.g. folder structure on computer, login data, etc.).
                                        <br> The picture shows schematically how the conversion of the generated batch file into an executable GAMS script could look like.</p>

                                        <p>After the click on "Submit jobs" the generated batch file is available for download. In addition to this file, the ZIP file also contains all files necessary for the scenario calculations.

                                        <p>Job submission: <br>If a script that can be executed by GAMS has been created from the batch file (e.g. as described above), it can be called ('Job submission', see picture above). If the model calculations are to be performed on a compute server, this can now be done.
                                        <br>Either way, at the end of the calculations, the results should be available in the form of another ZIP file. As already mentioned, the results have to be isolated according to scenarios. This means that each scenario must be located in a separate directory named after the hash value of the scenario. The results must be available in CSV format and correspond to the GAMS symbols declared in the GAMS model. If a subsequent analysis is to be carried out with the integrated analysis tool PAVER, the trace file (*.trc) must also be available for each scenario in addition to the results in CSV format. As already mentioned above, the GAMS command for the creation of the trace file is already written to the batch file for each scenario.

These batch tags can also be used to compare different batch runs with each other with regard to scenario analyses to be carried out. </p>

                                        <p>The scenario comparison module is used to directly compare the input and output data of a small number of scenarios. The data which is displayed here corresponds to those GAMS Symbols which were marked within the corresponding GAMS model with the <img class="img-fluid" style="height:14px;" src="assets/images/onexternal.png" alt="$onExternalInput" /> / <img class="img-fluid" style="height:14px;" src="assets/images/offexternal.png" alt="$offExternalInput" /> and <img class="img-fluid" style="height:14px;" src="assets/images/onexternalout.png" alt="$onExternalOutput" /> / <img class="img-fluid" style="height:14px;" src="assets/images/offexternalout.png" alt="$offExternalOutput" /> tags, i.e. those symbols which were marked for inclusion into the WebUI. Conversely, this means that all parameters and scalar values which shall be compared in the WebUI must be marked in the GAMS model accordingly. More information about these tags can be found <a href="start.html#create-2">here</a>.
                                        <br>If two scenarios are to be compared, the slipt-screen display is particularly suitable. In this way, the data can be displayed side by side and compared. </p>
                                        <div class="section-block">
                                              <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/batch_img/split_screen_mode.png" alt="Integrated scenario comparison - split screen" />
                                        </div>
                                        <p>In addition to the split screen mode, several scenarios can also be compared lying side by side in individual tabs. This makes sense if more than 2 scenarios are to be compared.  You can switch between split screen mode and the representation of the scenarios in tabs via the navigation bar. </p>

                                        <p>The <b>comparison mode</b> makes comparing scenarios much more efficient and convenient. As soon as this option is activated in the navigation bar, switching the displayed data within a scenario is also performed for all other open scenarios. This means that if you change the symbol to be displayed in a scenario (e.g. switch from 'Price' to 'absolute error' in the picture above), the view also changes accordingly for the compared scenario(s). </p>
                                        <h6>PAVER:</h6>
                                        <p><a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Paver" target="_blank">PAVER</a> is an Open Source Environment for Automated Performance Analysis of Benchmarking Data. This tools is meant to simplify the task of solver performance data comparison and visualization by providing a variety of performance measurement tools with convenient and easy ways to represent (e.g. objective values, solution times, and result codes from multiple runs in order to summarize, gain insight, or detect inconsistencies) [Bussieck, Michael R., Steven P. Dirkse, and Stefan Vigerske. "PAVER 2.0: an open source environment for automated performance analysis of benchmarking data." Journal of Global Optimization 59.2-3 (2014): 259-275, <a href="http://www.gamsworld.org/performance/paver2/paver2_paper.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>].</p>
                                        <p><br>PAVER independently performs a variety of analyses regarding the performance of selected scenarios. A scenario is defined by the individual parameterization of its input data.  In addition to the input data, the results, i.e. the output data, are of course particularly interesting and relevant for a performance analysis.
                                        Paver uses this output data for its evaluations. So far, PAVER can read comma separated value (csv) files that contain in each line the outcome of a solver run (instance name, solver name, options file name, instance statistics, solving statistics, ...). With GAMS, files in this format can be generated with the options trace=file.trc and traceopt=3 which is done in the <a href="#scengen-3" class="scrollto">batch file</a> by default. </p>
                                        <br>Before the start of the PAVER analysis, the user is asked to define the criteria on the basis of which the scenarios are to be compared with each other. Basically, scenarios can be compared on the basis of:
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>scalar input data for the corresponding GAMS model<br/></li>
                                        <li>scalar output data for the corresponding GAMS model<br/></li>
                                        <li>all characteristics contained in the trace file<br/></li>
                                        <li>batch tags optionally assigned by the user for each batch run<br/></li>
                                        <li>Date of creation of a batch run<br/></li>
                                        <li>Owner. More information on this can be found <a href="management.html#add-1">here</a><br/></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p><b>Example:</b>
                                        <br>For the already discussed model pickstock the user can define the scalar compile-time parameters for the maximum number of stocks to select (alias 'MaxStock') and the number of training days (alias 'TrainingDays') as input data. These parameters are therefore comparable input data in PAVER.
                                        <br>Selectable compile-time parameters and GAMS options for a model run via the WebUI: </p>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>MaxStock<br/></li>
                                        <li>TrainingDay<br/></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>In addition to such input data of the model, scalar output values are also calculated in the GAMS model:  </p>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>last date of training period<br/></li>
                                        <li>Stock symbol header<br/></li>
                                        <li>fund header<br/></li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>All these compile-time parameters, GAMS options and scalar values are used as such in the corresponding GAMS model.

                                        <p>If external analyses are to be carried out instead of the WebUI's integrated analysis methods, this is also possible. For this purpose, the WebUI offers the possibility to download a selection of scenarios so that the corresponding data can be used elsewhere. Each scenario is stored in a separate folder. Such a scenario folder contains both input and output data in CSV format including scalar values from the trace file of the corresponding GAMS run. </p>
