# Documentation style guide
This style guide aims to standardize the structure and style of the documentation for the GAMS WebUI. When you write a new chapter, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use lively language: write as if you are a teacher in a classroom and use "**we**" when you explain something.
1. At the beginning of each chapter, first describe the problem to be solved. Then, use an example and explain how this problem can be solved using the WebUI. If needed, go into technical details at the end of each section. Use a new subsection for this. These technical subsections shall make sure that the reader can not only implement the example, but has an understanding of the inner workings of the WebUI.
1. Use images and gifs to support your examples.
1. Try to use the trnsport example whenever you can and if not use any of the other example models that come with the WebUI.
1. Try to keep the subject of your sentence close to the verb.
1. Make sure the **message** you want to convey in your sentence is in the *stress position*: it is located right before a colon, semicolon or period. (to learn more, read the articles by [George D. Gopen](https://www.georgegopen.com/the-litigation-articles.html))
1. Make sure, each sentence is connected to the previous one: your sentences must lead seamlessly forward. Use back references at the beginning of each sentence.
1. Use uniform terms. Especially when it comes to certain features of the WebUI, specific expressions should remain.
