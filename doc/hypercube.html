                                    <p>MIRO allows the user to load input data, manipulate it, start & stop the GAMS optimization run, inspect the results as well as save, manage and compare different scenarios.</p>
                                    <p>Beside this <i>base mode</i>, there is another one which allows to configure and evaluate so-called <a href="./faqs.html#def-hypercube-job">Hypercube jobs</a>. A Hypercube job describes the automated execution of a certain number of automatically generated scenarios that differ with regard to their parameterization.</p>
                                    <p>Let's get back to our <i>transport</i> example: In the MIRO <i>base mode</i>, among other things, we saw that we can determine the freight costs for the transportation of goods from suppliers to markets. We also learned that MIRO allows us to submit this particular scenario and fetch the results once its done.</p>
                                    <p>But what if we want to solve a multitude of such scenarios with different parameterizations? Say, we are interested in finding out how our model behaves with regard to a change in freight costs as well as other input parameters? To avoid having to configure and solve each scenario individually, there is the <a href="faqs.html#def-hypercube"><i>Hypercube</i></a> <i>mode</i>. The Hypercube mode allows us to automatically solve and examine a subset of the parameter space of our model. This is done by varying all scalar model parameters (zero-dimensional GAMS parameters) within a given range. As a consequence, a large number of scenarios can be configured and analyzed at once.</p>
                                    <p>Results of such Hypercube jobs can be stored and inspected directly in MIRO. For this purpose, the Automated Performance Analysis & Visualization tool <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Paver" target="_blank">PAVER</a> is already integrated. A direct comparison of scenarios in the scenario view (via split / tab view) is also available. You might also want to download a given subset of the scenarios you stored in MIRO and analyze them externally with the help of your own scripts.</p>
                                    <p>In short, the module presented here is designed to efficiently generate, store and analyze a multitude of scenarios.</p>

                                    <p>There is little to do to get from the MIRO <i>base mode</i> to the Hypercube interface. When you are in the base mode, 
                                    you can simply click the <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/hcube-button.png" width="25" height="25" align="middle" alt="Change to Hypercube mode" /> 
                                    button in the header bar and you will automatically be redirected. Alternatively, you can start the Hypercube mode directly via the switch: 
                                    <span class="code" style="white-space: nowrap;">miromode=1</span> (in addition to <span class="code" style="white-space: nowrap;">miro=launch</span>) 
                                    in the development mode:</p>
                                    <div class="section-block" style="text-align:center;">
                                        <img class="img-fluid" style="max-height:30pt; display:block; margin:auto;" src="assets/images/batch_img/batch_launch.png" alt="Launch MIRO in Hypercube mode" />
                                    </div>
                                    <p>Or from the command line:
                                    <span class="code" style="white-space: nowrap;">gams transport.gms miro=launch miromode=1</span></p>
                                    <p>MIRO automatically processes and adjusts your base mode configuration so that it will work in Hypercube mode.</p>
                                    <p>Visually, the Hypercube interface hardly differs from the regular mode. After starting the application, the following familiar startup screen appears.</p>

                                    <p>A <a href="./faqs.html#def-scenario">scenario</a> is characterized by a particular set of model input (and output) parameters. If, for example, for a run of the <i>transport</i> model, the freight cost is set to 90 and the minimum shipment of goods is set to 100, then this parameterization characterizes the scenario (together with the other input and output parameters). The Hypercube configuration discussed here makes it possible to automatically submit several of those scenarios at once. </p>
                                    <p>The configuration of such a Hypercube job for a model is done in the section <i>Configure Hypercube job</i>. Let's take a look at an example.</p>

                                        <p>If you compare the display of input data between a single run in MIRO base mode and the configuration of a Hypercube job, you will notice that some of the input widgets have been automatically transformed:</p>

                                        </div>
                                        <p>When we set up a run in the MIRO base mode, we could specify the freight cost as well as the minimum amount of goods to ship. Those are zero dimensional values. The very same scalars can now be specified within a given range: 
                                        The sliders we specified in the base mode have now become slider ranges. In addition, we can set a <i>step size</i> for each slider range.
                                        In addition, the single dropdown menu for selecting the problem type has been replaced by a multi dropdown menu.</p>

                                            Example: The scalar <i>minimum shipment</i> in the transport.json file is configured as follows: </p><pre><code class="language-json">"mins": {
   &#x22;widgetType&#x22;: &#x22;slider&#x22;,
   &#x22;alias&#x22;: &#x22;minimum shipment (MIP- and MINLP-only)&#x22;,
   &#x22;label&#x22;: &#x22;minimum shipment (MIP- and MINLP-only)&#x22;,
   &#x22;min&#x22;: 0,

   &#x22;default&#x22;: 100,
   &#x22;step&#x22;: 1,

}</code></pre>
                                            <p>This configuration now has the consequence that the scalar can still be selected in the scenario generation but the double slider is now a single slider again. Its selection remains fixed for each generated scenario of a Hypercube job.</p>

                                                  <p>Unlike scalar values, multidimensional symbols such as sets, parameters and multidimensional singleton sets cannot be varied within a Hypercube job configuraton. The data remains fixed in every created scenario of a job.
                                            However, this does not mean that Hypercube mode can only be used for zero dimensional symbols. In order to be able to vary data of  multidimensional symbols using the Hypercube job configuration, this must be implemented in the GAMS model itself. 
                                            For example, you can use a scalar in the model and assign different data to a multidimensional parameter in the model depending on the value of that scalar. If this scalar value is now varied during a Hypercube job, 
                                            this also affects the multidimensional parameter.</p>

                                        <p>MIRO also looks into the database where your previous runs are stored and checks whether a subset of the scenarios you want to commit have already been saved. If it finds results from previous runs, MIRO asks if it should commit only the scenarios that have not yet been executed, or if it should submit all of them again.<br>
                                        There are a number of reasons why you might want to re-submit certain scenarios. We will elaborate on these reasons in the next section that discusses the technical details of how MIRO sets up a Hypercube job. If you are reading this documentation for the first time, you might want to skip this next advanced (sub)section.

                                        <div id="hash-generation"  class="section-block" style="display:none">
                                          <p>
                                            You might be wondering how MIRO knows whether a job has already been submitted or rather how a job is identified. Each scenario is characterized by the set of all input datasets that are populated by MIRO. This means that when you change something in your model or your execution environment that is not known to MIRO, it will not be detected as a different scenario. Let's consider the case where you want to run a certain set of scenarios on your local machine and then on a compute cluser in order to perform some performance analyses. Since all of the input datasets that come from MIRO remain the same, MIRO thinks that the scenarios are identical. No attribute "compute environment" is known to MIRO.<br>
                                            A scenario is identified by a 256-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA-2</a> hash value that MIRO computes as follows:
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            For each scenario of a Hypercube job the GAMS call is compiled:
                                            <span class="code">gams transport.gms --HCUBE_STATIC_a=8bc030208cf6482932608872c5681310 --HCUBE_SCALAR_beta=0.86 --type="mip"</span>
                                          You probably notice some oddities: All of the inputs that come from MIRO are included in this call, even those that are not GAMS command line parameters. GAMS scalars are prefixed with the keyword <kbd>HCUBE_SCALAR_</kbd>; parameters and other multi-dimensional GAMS symbols with the keyword <kbd>HCUBE_STATIC_</kbd>. Furthermore, the value of parameter <span class="code">a</span> looks weird: MIRO hashes the csv representation of the parameter with a 128-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5" target="_blank">MD5</a> hash function. This way, we make sure that the parameter and thus the entire GAMS command changes when the table is modified and at the same time keep the call short.<br>
                                          The <kbd>HCUBE_SCALAR_</kbd> keyword instructs the GAMS compiler to assign the specified value not to a compile time variable but a GAMS symbol declared in your model.<br>
                                          Command line parameters (GAMS options and double dash parameters) are just appended as in any GAMS call.</p>
                                          Once the command is built, we hash this again with the aforementioned SHA-2 hash function and get an identifier of the form:
                                          <span class="code">7f14dcce0c726d215adae54daa2690b6a86b540cf4e3efaf9f97e8f4f3ab90a5</span>.
                                          <p>We end up with a (relatively) compact identifier of a scenario while also making sure that we have a valid file/directory name without any reserved characters. The obvious disadvantage is that there is no way to derive the input parameters from the hash.

Job tags are an identifier attached to all scenarios of a Hypercube job. Job tags can help you identify scenarios of a certain job or a group of jobs with similar attributes.
                                              This means that you can use job tags as part of your database queries in order to easily find certain scenarios that you are interested in. Additionally, job tags can also be used to compare different groups of scenarios that you are interested in via PAVER.</p>

                                            <p>When we submit the Hypercube job automatically, it will be executed in the background. Without going into too much detail, what happens here is simple:
                                            <br>First, a <a href="#manual-jobsubmit-general" class="scrollto">Hypercube file</a> which contains all scenario configurations is created by MIRO.
                                            This file gets converted into executable GAMS calls, which are then processed. The script which is responsible for this conversion is located in the <span class="code">/resources</span> folder of the MIRO installation directory and can be customized as needed.
                                            More about these steps in the section on <a href="#manual-jobsubmit-general" class="scrollto">manual execution</a> of a Hypercube job.</p>
                                            <p>Once a Hypercube job has been submitted, it is shown in the <i>Import results</i> section which can be accessed via the sidebar menu. There, all jobs are listed that are still running or whose results have not yet been imported. </p>

                                            <p>The overview shows for each submitted job the owner, the submission date and the (optional) specified job tag(s). In addition, the current status (<i>scheduled</i>, <i>running</i> or <i>completed</i>) is visible.
                                            The current log of a run can be accessed at any time (see image below) and results that have not yet been loaded into the database or are still pending can be discarded.
                                            As soon as a job has finished, the results can be loaded into the database with a click on <i>Import</i>. </p>

                                            This file contains all scenario configurations as individual GAMS calls. A Zip archive including this file is downloaded by clicking on <i>Submit job</i>.
                                            The ZIP archive has the following contents:</p>

                                              <li><i>static</i> folder
                                              <br>This folder contains all non-scalar (thus multidimensional) input data of the corresponding GAMS model. As explained <a href="#multi-dim-symbols" class="scrollto">here</a>, this data remains the same for all scenarios of a Hypercube job.</li>

                                              <br>This folder is a copy of the directory of the underlying GAMS model. If files are included in the model using relative paths, they should be located in this folder.</li>

                                            <p>When submitting your Hypercube job manually, you need to write a script that takes the information provided in the <i>.hcube</i> file and transform it into some sort of executable script. Of course, you can simply take the <span class="code">hcube_submission.gms</span> file that lies in the archive you downloaded. In case you need to customize this script e.g. because you want to send the GAMS jobs to some sort of compute server, you will need to adjust this file accordingly.</p>

                                              <br>A scenario is defined by a set of input data that is provided by MIRO. This data includes sets, parameters, scalars, command-line parameters etc.
                                              All of this information is provided in the GAMS call in some sort (again, if you want to learn more read <a href="#hash-generation" class="scrollto">this section</a>):
                                                <ul>
                                                  <li>Static data:
                                                  <br>Non-scalar / multi-dimensional input data such as parameters are used as fixed files for all scenarios of a Hypercube job. In the Hypercube job file such static datasets are specified as <span class="code">--HCUBE_STATIC_&lt;parameter-name&gt;=&lt;hash&gt;</span>.
                                                  <br>Example:
                                                  In the transport model, there is a parameter <span class="code">a</span> which defines the capacity of plants. When this parameter is used for a Hypercube job, the Hypercube job file includes the substring: <span class="code">--HCUBE_STATIC_a=131a04011c1c227dccbbbc7e742073e2</span>.
                                                  <br>You can safely ignore the compile time variable. It does not serve any purpose other than being part of the hash that identifies the scenario. This way, MIRO makes sure it assigns a different hash to scenarios with exactly the same set of scalars but different multi-dimensional parameters. What you need to make sure of, however, is that the static files are correctly named and located in the directory named: <i>static</i>. Else, the GAMS compiler can't find the data for these symbols.
                                                  </li>

                                                  <br>Scalars can usually not be set via a GAMS call, but are defined in the model. In order to be able to set scalars via the command line, MIRO adds a special prefix:
                                                  <br>When a scalar is specified, this is recorded in the Hypercube job file as
                                                  <span class="code">--HCUBE_SCALAR_&lt;scalar-name&gt;=&lt;scalar-value&gt;</span>, e.g. <span class="code">--HCUBE_SCALAR_f=90</span> for scalar <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">f</span> and a value of 90.
                                                  To continue this example, if a GAMS model is called with <span class="code">miro=run</span> and the compile-time variable <span class="code">--HCUBE_SCALAR_f=90</span>, a scalar <span class="code">f</span> is searched in the list of symbols declared in your GAMS model and, if declared, set to the value of the compile-time variable, i.e. 90.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                              <li>Trace file command:
                                              <br>In case you are interested in doing performance analysis using the analysis tool <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/Paver" target="_blank">PAVER</a>, which is integrated into MIRO, you need to make sure to generate trace files for your scenarios.
                                              Unless otherwise specified in your app configuration, MIRO will already include the GAMS command line options for creating trace files for each scenario (here:
                                              <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">trace=_sys_trace_transport.trc traceopt=3</span>). Note that MIRO will only read the last record in the trace file (the last solve statement in your model)!</li>
                                              <li>When executing Hypercube jobs, you should always include the option <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">miro=run</span> as well as the double dash parameter <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">--hcube=1</span>. This instructs the GAMS compiler that you are executing a MIRO Hypercube job.</li>
                                              <li>The GAMS options <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">execMode=0</span> and <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">lo=3</span> are relevant for the automated execution of a Hypercube job and can be changed or ignored for the manual execution.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Now we need to transform the Hypercube file in such a way that GAMS can understand it. Additionally, the results need to be saved in such a way that MIRO can validate and import them. This is the topic of the following subsection.</p>
                                        </div>
                                        <div  id="manual-jobsubmit-run"  class="section-block">
                                            <h5 class="block-title">Run the Hypercube job</h5>
                                            <p>Each line in the Hypercube job file consists of a scenario-specific hash value followed by an executable 
                                            GAMS call. For each line, we need to remember the hash, extract the call and execute it. Later we store the 
                                            results of each run in a folder that we name by the hash. The <i>hcube_submission.gms</i> script that is 
                                            invluded in the archive you downloaded provides you with a template (in this case using Python) to do just 
                                            that. Depending on your infrastructure, you can either extend this script or write a new one from scratch. 
                                            The only thing you need to make sure is that when you retrieve the results, they must be structured in a 
                                            special way in order to import them back into MIRO. The graphic below shows schematically how the 
                                            conversion of the generated Hypercube job file into an executable GAMS script could look like.</p>

                                            <p>At the end of the calculations, the results should be available in the form of another ZIP archive. In order for MIRO to accept the archive as a valid set of scenarios, the archive needs to be structured in a certain way:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>The input and output datasets for a particular scenario need to be placed in a folder that is named after the hash value of this particular scenario. Each of these folders need to be located in the root directory of your zip file.
                                            <div class="section-block">
                                                <img class="img-fluid" style="display:block; margin:auto; max-height:200px;" src="assets/images/batch_img/upload_zip.png" alt="contents of the ZIP file to be uploaded" />
                                            </div>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>There are some files that must exist in order for MIRO to accept a particular scenario. Other datasets are optional and don't have to be included in the zip archive. The mandatory files are:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li id="csv-scalars">scalars.csv<br>In case your model contains any scalar input data (including GAMS command line parameters), you need to include this information in the directory of your scenarios. This means that you need to convert the data that is contained in the GAMS call into csv data. Again, in case you are not sure how to do that, take a look at how this is done in the <i>hcube_submission.gms</i> file.
                                            <br>Note that the header of this csv file must be: <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">"Scalar,Description,Value"</span> where <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">Scalar</span> stands for the GAMS Symbol name, <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">Description</span> for the optional explanatory text and <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">Value</span> contains the value set by the user from within MIRO. Symbol name and value can be extracted from the Hypercube job file, the explanatory text can simply be left blank.</li>
                                            <li>scalars_out.csv<br>This file contains all scalar output values specified between the <code class="language-gams">$onExternalOutput
                                            </code> / <code class="language-gams">$offExternalOutput
                                            </code>  tags. Just like any other output files, this is generated automatically after the model executed successfully.
                                            <br><b>Note:</b> If, for whatever reason, a model calculation is aborted, output files (including scalar output) are not generated. The consequence is that those scenarios will be considered invalid and won't be imported into the database by MIRO. In case you are also interested in scenarios that did not solve successfully, you need to manually create a file called <i>calars_out.csv</i>. This file needs to contain data for all output scalars that were declared in your model in order for the scenario to be accepted.</li>
                                            <li>_sys_trace_&lt;modelname&gt;.trc<br><a href="https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GamsCall.html#GAMSAOtraceopt" target="_blank">Trace file</a> of the scenario run. This file contains numerous run statistics which are used for the the integrated performance analysis tool PAVER. The Hypercube job file already contains the GAMS options for generating the trace file automatically. In case you specified (in your MIRO app configuration) that you are not interested in trace information (option <code class="language-json">saveTraceFile</code> set to <code class="language-json">false</code>), mustn't be included in your scenario data. You can find more information about the trace file <a href="http://www.gamsworld.org/performance/trace.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Apart from the input scalar file, which your custom script needs to generate, the files are generated automatically when solving a scenario with the command line parameter <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">miro=run</span>. Their format is internally defined by MIRO and should not be changed. If scenario data does not contain all mandatory files, the data for this scenario will be ignored and thus not stored in the database.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>In addition to the mandatory files mentioned above, there may be other files in the result folder of a scenario. If <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">miro=run</span> is set, a csv file with results is created for each output parameter declared in the GAMS model between the <code class="language-gams">$onExternalOutput
                                            </code> / <code class="language-gams">$offExternalOutput
                                            </code> tags. For example, when the Parameters <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">results</span> and <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">performance</span> are declared between those tags, the csv files <i>results.csv</i> and <i>performance.csv</i> will be written by GAMS.
                                            For these files the following rules apply:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>Result files of output parameters are not mandatory, but optional for the upload into the database.</li>
                                            <li>The results must be in csv format.</li>
                                            <li>Csv files must be named after the parameters declared in the GAMS model between the <code class="language-gams">$onExternalOutput
                                            </code> / <code class="language-gams">$offExternalOutput
                                            </code> tags. Each output parameter declared there must be stored in a separate csv file. Exceptions are scalar values, see <a href="#csv-scalars" class="scrollto">here</a>.</li>
                                            <li>It is mandatory that the header line of a csv file is identical to the corresponding parameter declared in GAMS.
                                            <br>Example: In the (slightly adapted) transport model, the output parameter <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">schedule(i,j,scheduleHdr)</span> should appear in MIRO.
                                            <pre><code class="language-gams">Set scheduleHdr                     'schedule header' / 'cap', 'demand', 'quantities' /;
                                            
$onExternalOutput
Table schedule(i,j,scheduleHdr) 'shipment quantities in cases';
$offExternalOutput

schedule(i,j,'cap')        = a(i);
schedule(i,j,'demand')     = b(j);
schedule(i,j,'quantities') = x.l(i,j);</code></pre>
                                            <p>The resulting <i>schedule.csv</i> contains the header row <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">i,j,cap,demand,quantities</span>,
                                            which corresponds to the first two domains <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">i</span> and <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">j</span> 
                                            as well as the set elements of the declared header <span class="code" style="white-space:nowrap">scheduleHdr</span> (see image below).

                                            <p>As already mentioned, csv files are usually generated automatically. However, any of the optional files can be deleted manually (or via a custom script) so that they are not included in the database. This can be useful e.g. if you want to save disk space or to speed up database queries.</p>
                                        
                                            <p>The following figure summarizes the steps required to move from a Hypercube job file created by MIRO to a ZIP archive that you can import back into MIRO:</p>

                                        <p>Scenarios that have been imported into the MIRO database can be loaded at a later time for subsequent analyses. The <i>load scenarios</i> module is a graphical way to build datbase queries. It gives you a lot of flexibility and power to get exactly those scenarios you are interested in. Let's take a look at an example:</p>
                                        <br>In our <i>transport</i> model, we have three input scalars that we import from MIRO:
                                        <pre><code class="language-gams">$onExternalInput
Scalar f    'freight in dollars per case per thousand miles' / 90 /
       minS 'minimum shipment (MIP- and MINLP-only)' / 100 /
       beta 'beta (MINLP-only)' / 0.95 /;
$offExternalInput
</code></pre>                    <p>Of particular interest are scalar inputs and outputs, as you can easily use them to filter your data. More specifically, it is possible to filter your database tables by the following GAMS symbols:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                          <li>Scalars</li>
                                          <li>Singleton sets</li>
                                          <li>Double-dash parameters</li>
                                          <li>GAMS options</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>In addition to those scenario-specific filters, you can also use scenario metadata such as the optionally defined job tags and the date of creation in a database query.</p>
                                        <p>The MIRO Hypercube load module lets you combine any of these filters with the logical operators AND and OR (see figure below).</p>
                                        <div class="section-block" style="text-align:center;">

                                        </div>
                                        <p>Once you have set all the filters you are interested in, you can execute your query by clicking on the <i>Query database</i> button. After the results have been retrieved, the page will be updated and you will see a table with the scenarios that correspond to your query. In the resulting table, you again have the option of selecting the scenarios that really interest you. If you want to load a scenario that was part of a Hypercube job into the base mode, you can get its hash value by clicking <i>Show Hash</i> in the lower right corner. Note that you can only show the hash of one scenario at a time, so don't select more than one row before clicking this button. To learn more about how to import a Hypercube scenario using its hash, read <a href="./start.html#import-data">here</a>.</p>
                                        <p>Whenever you have chosen the scenarios you want to compare, you will be asked to choose a comparison/analysis method:</p>

                                            <p>The scenario comparison module is used to directly compare the input and output data for a small number of scenarios. The scenario comparison module is pretty much identical to the one in the <a href="./start.html#scenario-comparison">base mode</a>: This means that the charts you configured in the base mode will also work in the Hypercube mode. However, there are some subtle differences: A scenario that resulted from a Hypercube job does not have a name assigned (the name is the 256-bit SHA-2 hash). As the hash values are hard to distinguish for the human eye, MIRO will assign a number to each scenario you import. This number is simply a counter that increments every time you load a new scenario and resets when you close the current session. You might be interested in seeing two scenarios that you find particularly important, side by side: all you need to do is remember the numbers that were assigned to those two scenarios and switch to the split view comparison mode. If you load a scenario here, you will notice that there is a new <i>local</i> tab. Here you can choose any of the scenarios that is already opened in the tab view comparison mode:

This tool is designed to simplify the task of comparing and visualizing solver performance data (solution times, return codes etc.) by providing a variety of performance measurement tools with practical and simple visualization capabilities. This way you can get some performance summaries over multiple runs or detect inconsistencies. [Bussieck, Michael R., Steven P. Dirkse, and Stefan Vigerske. "PAVER 2.0: an open source environment for automated performance analysis of benchmarking data." Journal of Global Optimization 59.2-3 (2014): 259-275, <a href="http://www.gamsworld.org/performance/paver2/paver2_paper.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>].</p>
                                            <p><br>PAVER bases its analysis entirely on the GAMS <a href="http://www.gamsworld.org/performance/trace.htm" target="_blank">trace files</a> that were generated during your model runs. Since PAVER was originally designed to compare multiple solvers based on a number of model instances (e.g. the <a href="http://miplib.zib.de/" target="_blank">MIPLIB</a>), we keep this vocabulary but use it in a more abstract way: A "solver" in terms of MIRO is a set of attributes that you would like to compare. These attributs can be any criterion you could also use to filter your database: the input and output scalars defined in your model as well as some metadata such as the job tags you assigned. Based on these attributes, the scenarios you selected will be split into groups. The remaining attributes define a "model".</p>
                                            <p>Let's assume you want to compare how sensitive your GAMS model is with regard to computation power: You therefore generate a Hypercube job with multiple scenarios and solve it once on your local machine and then again on a High-Performance Computing Cluster. You assign the tag "HPC" to the job solved on the cluster and the tag "Local" to the one that was solved on your local machine. When you start PAVER, you will be asked to select the attributes that define your "solver". Since we want to compare the performance statistics of the job executed on our local machine with the HPC, we select <i>Job Tags</i> as the attribute for comparison:</p>

                                            </div>
                                            <p>What happens when we now launch PAVER is that the trace data collected from the selected scenarios is split into the groups "HPC" and "Local". The "models" are named after the remaining attributes. Let's assume that your model has two input scalars: <span class="code">cost_coeff</span> and <span class="code">demand_coeff</span>. In your Hypercube task, you have varied these coefficients in a range between 2 and 12 with a step size of 2 and a range between 90 and 100 with a step size of 2. The names of your "models" would therefore be: "2\90", "2\92", ..., "4\100"; note that different attributes are delimited with a backward slash. Each combination of input scalars results in a new "model":</p>

                                            </div>
                                            <p>Per default, all input scalars are what we call model-defining: They contribute to the PAVER "model" name. This means that when the scalar changes, PAVER would regard it as an new, independent model. Output scalars and metadata attributes are ignored meaning that different values would still be regarded as the same "model". If you want to change this default setting, there is a small arrow in the lower left corner of the PAVER set-up dialog box that lets you do so:</p>

                                            </div>
                                            Basically, scenarios can be compared on the basis of:
                                            <ul>
                                            <li>Scalar input data<br/></li>
                                            <li>Scalar output data<br/></li>
                                            <li>Job tags<br/></li>
                                            <li>Date of creation of a Hypercube job<br/></li>
                                            <li>Owner of a Hypercube job<br/></li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Once you have decided which attributes you want to use to compare your scenarios, you can start Paver. The results of your analysis could look like this: </p>

                                        The structure of the downloaded data is very similar to the one you upload when you execute your <a href="#manual-jobsubmit-import-rules" class="scrollto">Hypercube jobs manually</a>:
                                        Every scenario is located in its own folder, where the name of the folder is the hash value of the scenario. Inside this folder, you will find the csv representation of the input and output datasets as well as the trace data (in case it was stored).</p>
