#Elasto-Hydrodynamic Lubrication
This MIRO App is based on the ehl_kost model from MCPLIB.
In this model, the classical problem of elasto-hydrodynamic
lubrication of cylinders in line contact is formulated as a
complementarity problem (or MCP) as described in the Kostreva
reference below.  The user can input 3 parameters: the number of grid
points used in the discretization, the load on the cylindrical
bearing, and the rotational speed of the bearing.  The outputs,
i.e. the lubricant pressure and lubricant film thickness in a range
centered on the contact point of the two cylinders, are shown as line
charts.
