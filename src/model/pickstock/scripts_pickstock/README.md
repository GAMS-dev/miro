# Run custom analysis script

To run the custom analysis that comes with the pickstock example model, you will need to set up a Python environment first:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib
```

You also need the GAMS Python API. You can install it via:

```
python <path_to_gams_sys_dir>/apifiles/Python/api_39/setup.py build -b ${TMPDIR} install
```

Once you've done that you need to tell MIRO about your Python environment by adding it to the PATH.
