# Traveling Salesman Problem
This model tries to find the shortest route through all cities given by the
user. To select the cities you want to travel through, simply click on the map that you find under the `City location information` tab. To remove an existing marker, click on the marker. You can also drag the markers around to place them in a different location.

At the tab `Advanced Settings` one can specify certain values to limit the
runtime of the model (at the cost of not finding the solution for all cities)
given.

This app comes with two example datasets:
- `default` lists the capital cities of 44 U.S. states (some were left out in order to work with a DEMO license)
- `defaultGermany` lists the capital cities of all 16 states in Germany
