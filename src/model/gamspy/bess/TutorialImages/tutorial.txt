MAKE GAMS/GAMSPY MODEL

add is_miro_input/output/table
domain forwarding -> header sets, since dataframe has to be melted

RAPIT PROTOYPING

input self explanatory 
-> maybe timeline graph already with drawback can't edit and see graph
-> custom widget

output show some graphs 
-> can already check load fulfillment
-> and that everything stays in the given limits
-> if not found an error (can be used before the model is finished!!!)

CONFIG MODE

Set Title, Logo, ReadMe
make the views that seemed useful during rapit prototyping into the default
for scalars add sliders
Objectiv value (cost) as value box (scalar output Parameter)

if multiple views exist can combine them in Dashboard
think of KPI, make scalar Parameters for them
-> only need to touch json files!!
-> maybe gif of Daschboard?

make a custom log direktly in the gamspy code
-> especially good for data validation

FINE TUNING WITH CUSTOM CODE

custom widget for time input, directly update the graph

small custom renderer for cumsum(battery_power) to get the storage at every time 
-> add this to the dashboard

custom renderer -> sankey diagram

FURTHER PROSPECTS

custom export -> to database or/and pdf
custom inport -> time data from database (possible updates regularly)
deploy -> Miroserver
