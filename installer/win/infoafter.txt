Thank you for installing the beta version of the GAMS WebUI. 
If you encounter any bugs or have any comments, please contact: support@gams.com.

The sample models can be found in your "~/Documents/" folder (if you selected them for installation).
To start the WebUI from within GAMS Studio, start it with the compile time variable: "--webui=launch". Have fun!
